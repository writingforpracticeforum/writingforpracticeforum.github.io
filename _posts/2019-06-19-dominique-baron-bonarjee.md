Dominique Baron-Bonarjee's practice is based on physical inquiry as a way into expanded modes of cognition and altered states of consciousness. Her current PhD in the Art Department at Goldsmiths entitled Space of the Nameless explores wobbling as a mode of transit for unstable times. Recent exhibitions and works: Collapse at Chisenhale Dance Space, lecture-performance at Tai Kwun Centre in Hong Kong (ASAP Symposium, 2019); screening at Tate Exchange (2019); artist-in-residence at Cloud DansLab,The Hague in 2018. – dominiquebb.com
