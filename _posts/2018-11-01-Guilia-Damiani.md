**Guilia Damiani** is a writer and curator based in London, completing a PhD in Art at Goldsmiths University (AHRC scholarship). She specialises in performance and collaborates with artists to create performances from archival and feminist practices.

**Kristen Kreider** is a writer and artist. Her research stems from an interest in the poetics of thought, its materialization as form, and a concern with how artworks relate to the world. She has published poetry, essays, journal articles and a single-authored monograph entitled *Poetics & Place: The Architecture of Sign, Subject and Site* (IB Tauris, 2014). The latter explores how specific artworks generate meaning through a ‘material poetics’ in relation to place, develops a critical methodology for engaging with them, and investigates their ethical potential and political imperative. The book concludes with a discussion of the ethics of relation, opening a debate concerning the role of empathy within contemporary, politically-engaged practices in art and poetry. – [gold.ac.uk/art/staff/kreider-kristen](http://www.gold.ac.uk/art/staff/kreider-kristen)
