title: "Forum #14 - Sophie Sleigh-Johnson with Sharon Kivland"
---

Artist and PhD researcher Sophie Sleigh-Johnson (Goldsmiths) will present new writing. Artist and writer Sharon Kivland (Sheffield Hallam University) will act as respondent. The texts are an intersection between prose/ site writing/ chorological investigation. Sophie will present an excerpt of new work on writer and artist Antonin Artaud's 'heretical pilgrimage' to Ireland in 1937, which we will read alongside an excerpt by Tim Robinson, also concerning the same site in Ireland.

She has been called a poet, eleven times to date, much to her surprise.
