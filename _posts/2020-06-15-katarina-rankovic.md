Katarina Rankovic is a text-based artist exploring the extent to which personhood is encoded in character, and whether fictional characters can be reverse-engineered into something approximating persons; into literary prototypes of general artificial intelligence. Recent projects involve Anomaline, a novel about a lethargic antiperson; as using personality tests on her performed fictional characters, in a bid to problematise the distinction between 'genuine' being and 'disingenuous' performing. As a Serb-born-in-Yorkshire-raised-in-Norway, both the theory and practice of Katarina's work originates from the daily necessity of inhabiting and switching between many selves. – katarinarankovic.art
