Katarina is a video, performance and text-based artist exploring the extent to which personhood is encoded in character, and whether fictional characters can be reverse engineered into something approximating persons; as literary prototypes of general AI.

Current projects include 'Anomaline', a novel about an anti-person; 'Vernacular Spectacular', a one-woman empathy circus, and 'Scripting for Agency', a PhD project at Goldsmiths College. As a Serb born in Yorkshire, raised in Norway and working in London, both the theory and practice of Katarina's work originates from the daily necessity of inhabiting and switching between many selves.
