I"=<p>Whilst online conferencing is not our usual format for a conversation, which is usually informed by a certain kind of co-presence in a room, as Ellyâ€™s work explores the digital body we are hoping that this will add a further experiential dimension as we find ourselves transformed into data through zoom. We hope the potential trickiness of communicating in this way will inform the discussion. Artist and PhD researcher (Goldsmiths) Elly Clarke will present new writing. Poet, fiction writer and educator Keith Jarrett (University of London) joins as respondent.</p>
