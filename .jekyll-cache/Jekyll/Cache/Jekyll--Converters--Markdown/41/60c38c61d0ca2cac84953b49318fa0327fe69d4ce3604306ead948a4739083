<p><strong>Johanna Linsley</strong> is an artist, writer and producer. Her work is iterative, research-based and focused on performance. It often results in projects with multiple versions or outcomes. Current interests include documentation, procedure, listening (especially eavesdropping), queer domesticity, collaboration, and formations of the public. An interest in the speculative and fantastical underlies this work. Johanna is part of the London-based live art team <em>I’m With You</em>, which investigates queerness, domesticity, private life and public space. She is also a founding partner of <em>UnionDocs</em>, a centre for documentary art in Brooklyn, New York. Johanna is a researcher on the Wellcome Trust-funded project <em>Challenging Archives</em> at the Theatre Collection Live Art Archives at the University of Bristol. She received a PhD in performance studies from Queen Mary, University of London. – <a href="http://www.jhlinsley.com">jhlinsley.com</a></p>
