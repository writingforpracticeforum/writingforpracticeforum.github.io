<p>Ceri Morgan is Senior Lecturer in English and Creative Writing at Keele University and works on literary geographies, place-writing, geopoetics (site-responsive creative practices), walking studies, and geohumanities. A specialist of Québec fiction, Ceri has worked on projects on Montreal, ’urbs (suburban, exurban, and rural spaces), and regions. Key themes besides the spatial include language and translation, mobilities and belonging, memory, temporality, and identity. Since 2014, she has worked increasingly on geopoetics as a participatory practice, and has led workshops on a variety of themes, including mining, food, persistent pain, and deindustrialisation. In April 2020, Ceri set up an online reading and writing group, Microclimates, in response to social and spatial restrictions prompted by the pandemic. She has published some fiction, creative nonfiction, and prose-poetry, notably in Littoral (2017), GeoHumanities (2019), and NAWE Writing in Education (2020). Her prose-poem, ‘Avenue Bernard’ was broadcast on RTE Radio 1 extra and RTE Radio 1 in Spring and Summer 2020.</p>
