<p><strong>Dominique Baron-Bonarjee</strong>â€™s practice is based on physical inquiry as a way into expanded modes of cognition and altered states of consciousness. Her current PhD in the Art Department at Goldsmiths entitled <em>Space of the Nameless</em> explores wobbling as a mode of transit for unstable times. Recent exhibitions and works: <em>Collapse</em> at Chisenhale Dance Space, lecture-performance at Tai Kwun Centre in Hong Kong (ASAP Symposium, 2019); screening at Tate Exchange (2019); artist-in-residence at Cloud DansLab, The Hague in 2018. â€“ <a href="http://www.dominiquebb.com">dominiquebb.com</a></p>
