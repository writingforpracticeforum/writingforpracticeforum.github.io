<p><strong>Kristen Kreider</strong> is a writer and artist. Her research stems from an interest in the poetics of thought, its materialization as form, and a concern with how artworks relate to the world. She has published poetry, essays, journal articles and a single-authored monograph entitled <em>Poetics &amp; Place: The Architecture of Sign, Subject and Site</em> (IB Tauris, 2014). The latter explores how specific artworks generate meaning through a â€˜material poeticsâ€™ in relation to place, develops a critical methodology for engaging with them, and investigates their ethical potential and political imperative. The book concludes with a discussion of the ethics of relation, opening a debate concerning the role of empathy within contemporary, politically-engaged practices in art and poetry. â€“ <a href="http://www.gold.ac.uk/art/staff/kreider-kristen">gold.ac.uk/art/staff/kreider-kristen</a></p>
