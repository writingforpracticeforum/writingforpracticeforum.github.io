I"Œ<p>Kate Pickering will share extracts from <em>There is a Miracle in your Mouth</em>, an experimental text formed of several threads: mythic stories of Lakewood (North Americaâ€™s largest megachurch) within the broader context of American Evangelical climate crisis skepticism; an account of an oncoming hurricane based on research into hurricane Harvey; and lastly, drawing upon the writing and cell of Julian of Norwich, Pickering imagines her body as a building about to be breached by a flood.</p>
