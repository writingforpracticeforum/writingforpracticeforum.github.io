I"_<p>Rachel Smith will present some excerpts from a new work which takes an insolent but smitten route through an existing text. The work forms part of the wider development of her read(writ)ing method using drawing, photography, and writing and will be accompanied by reading fragments from Karen Barad, Roland Barthes, and Hélène Cixous.</p>

<p><strong>Rachel Smith</strong> is an artist and educator with a practice across Drawing, Photography, and Writing. She completed her PhD at Sheffield Hallam University in May 2020: <em>Drawing out Language: From Or to And, Disrupting Dualism through Conceptual Poetics</em>. She is interested in the production of artist books, using the page space to explore hybrid image and text experiments. Her work meanders through existing texts, fragmenting narratives, appropriating text, and materialising association, error, and distraction to visualise how sense might be sought, rejected, and re-fused. As part of her Ph.D. research, she developed a method which explores the act of reading as writing as making — <em>read(writ)ing</em> — the term underpins her practice which cuts together-apart processes related to these actions.</p>

<p>She has exhibited widely in the UK, recently having her work, <em>Catching sight of the Salt cellar</em>, included in the group show: The Salon for a Speculative Future at Chisenhale Studios, London and the resulting compendium of work, published by MA Bibliotheque. She took part in the first <em>Interrupteur</em> Artist residency in the faculty of Humanities at the University of Sheffield in 2018. This two-month residency involved working with Artists and forging dialogue with Academics from the Humanities dept. to explore and create collaborations between practice and research ideas. Her latest book <em>Read(writ)ing words: a meandering material dialogue</em> is available from Penteract Press, and she has been interviewed for the <a href="https://penteractpress.com/p-p-p/2020/6/6/episode-07-rachel-smith">Penteract Poetry Podcast</a>. – <a href="http://www.rachelartsmith.com">rachelartsmith.com</a></p>
