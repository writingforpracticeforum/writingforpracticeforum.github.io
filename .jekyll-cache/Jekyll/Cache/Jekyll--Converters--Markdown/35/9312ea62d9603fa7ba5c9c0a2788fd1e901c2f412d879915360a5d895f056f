<p><strong>Caroline Campbell</strong> is an artist, writer, filmmaker and practice-based researcher in Goldsmiths Visual Cultures Department. Caroline works under the name Loitering Theatre individually and with other collaborators. Loitering Theatre work across video, text, mixed message, false flags, meme magic, artificial intellect, viral viral interference and future archaeologies of time; as they seek to make the intangible of networks manifest. Their work often engages with the hidden structures and abstractions of accelerated networked capitalism and the futurisms of the military industrial complex. Loitering Theatre use varied techniques to decode and oppose current systems of consensus reality. They create radical synapses between future-present sci-fi technologies and lost systems of ancient ritual power. Along the way, time is stretched and bent and technology no longer develops along its linear path. – <a href="http://www.loiteringtheatre.org">loiteringtheatre.org</a></p>
