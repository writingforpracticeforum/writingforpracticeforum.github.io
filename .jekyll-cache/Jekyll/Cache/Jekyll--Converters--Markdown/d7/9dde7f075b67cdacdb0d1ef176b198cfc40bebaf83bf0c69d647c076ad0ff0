<p><strong>Katarina RankoviÄ‡</strong> is a text-based artist exploring the extent to which personhood is encoded in character, and whether fictional characters can be reverse-engineered into something approximating persons; into literary prototypes of general artificial intelligence. Recent projects involve <em>Anomaline</em>, a novel about a lethargic antiperson; and using personality tests on her performed fictional characters, in a bid to problematise the distinction between â€˜genuineâ€™ being and â€˜disingenuousâ€™ performing. As a Serb-born-in-Yorkshire-raised-in-Norway, both the theory and practice of Katarinaâ€™s work originates from the daily necessity of inhabiting and switching between many selves. â€“ <a href="http://www.katarinarankovic.art">katarinarankovic.art</a></p>
