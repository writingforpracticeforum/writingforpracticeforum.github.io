<p><strong>Rowena Harris</strong> is an artist and PhD candidate at Goldsmiths. Her research encompasses theories on the datalogical in relation to neuroatypicality, pursued through creative writing, material practice, and film work. Within this she explores a relation between systemic use of cognitive enhancements by Silicon Valley and the contemporary system by which the datalogical functions, seeking to give voice to neuroatypical people that maybe absent from this space, and to consider another place of thinking differently. – <a href="http://www.rowenaharris.com">rowenaharris.com</a></p>
