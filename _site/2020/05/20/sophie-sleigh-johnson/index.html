<p>Artist and PhD researcher Sophie Sleigh-Johnson (Goldsmiths) will present new writing. Artist and writer Sharon Kivland (Sheffield Hallam University) will act as respondent. The texts are an intersection between prose/ site writing/ chorological investigation. Sophie will present an excerpt of new work on writer and artist Antonin Artaud’s ‘heretical pilgrimage’ to Ireland in 1937, which we will read alongside an excerpt by Tim Robinson, also concerning the same site in Ireland.</p>

<p><strong>Sophie Sleigh-Johnson</strong> is a writer, artist and musician. She is the author of <em>Chthonic Index</em> - in collaboration with Simon Martin and Timothy Martin - published in 2015. She is currently working on a PhD at Goldsmiths. Recent projects include <em>Cealdwiellla</em> with New Noveta, and <em>Machine of Instant Utility</em> at Cabinet Gallery (group show). She occasionally broadcasts <em>Chthonic Live</em> on Resonance 104.4 FM, and she lives in Southend-On-Sea, Essex. – <a href="http://www.sophiesleigh-johnson.co.uk">sophiesleigh-johnson.co.uk</a></p>

<p><strong>Sharon Kivland</strong> is an artist and writer. Her work considers what is put at stake by art, politics, and psychoanalysis. She is currently working on the natural form, of course. She has been called a poet, eleven times to date, much to her surprise. She is also an editor and publisher, the latter under the imprint MA BIBLIOTHÈQUE. – <a href="https://www.shu.ac.uk/about-us/our-people/staff-profiles/sharon-kivland">shu.ac.uk/sharon-kivland</a></p>
