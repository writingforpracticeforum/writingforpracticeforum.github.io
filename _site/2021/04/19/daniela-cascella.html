<p>Daniela Cascella is an Italian writer whose texts articulate tensions and points of contact between the literary and the sonic, and propose a range of approaches to creative-critical writing through experiments with form and voice. She is the author, in English, of Singed (Equus Press, 2017), F.M.R.L. (Zer0 Books, 2015), En Abîme (Zer0 Books, 2012); and in Italian, of The Cure: The Edge of the World (Arcana, 2008), and Scultori di suono (Tuttle, 2005). Daniela lectures and publishes internationally, and often collaborates with musicians and artists in readings and editorial/curatorial projects. She is an Associate Lecturer in the MA Sound Arts at LCC / University of the Arts London, and is completing her Ph.D. at Sheffield Hallam University where she has been developing a project around Chimeric Writing that will result in two books, the former of which is forthcoming on Risking Education / Punctum Books.</p>
