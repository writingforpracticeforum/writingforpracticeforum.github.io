&lt;p&gt;Dani Smith is a painter and writer in her first year of PhD research at Goldsmiths, University of London. Her research project: So the Cursed May Conjure, is a spiritual exploration of selfhood that engages the mechanics of black feminism and autotheory to query a range of metaphysical trauma as withstanding effects of normalised violences against black female bodies. Converging intimate storytelling and multidisciplinary painting methods, Dani’s practice illustrates examples of modern black female misrepresentations, its various forms of consequences, and executions of resistance against prevailing ideologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zoë Mendelson has an expanded field practice that owes its spatialisation, historical narratives and compositional framework to painting. She has exhibited and performed widely in the UK and abroad, including Fondation Cartier, Paris; CRAC Alsace, Chapter, Cardiff and Science Museum, London. Zoë’s research engages disorder as a culturally produced phenomenon, in parallel to its clinical counterpart. She has a PhD from Central St Martins and is Course Leader for BA Fine Art Painting and Wimbledon College of Arts, UAL. Zoë co-curates the network paintingresearch with Geraint Evans and is co-founder and editor of The Edit, an online inclusive, de-canonised bibliography for students in Fine Art and related fields, now used in Arts education internationally.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Dani Smith will present excerpts from a collection of d​iary entries detailing her time returning home to Los Banos, a small farming town in central California, for Christmas 2020.

&lt;p&gt;Rachel Smith is an artist and educator with a practice across Drawing, Photography, and Writing. She completed her PhD at Sheffield Hallam University in May 2020: Drawing out Language: From Or to And, Disrupting Dualism through Conceptual Poetics. She is interested in the production of artist books, using the page space to explore hybrid image and text experiments. Her work meanders through existing texts, fragmenting narratives, appropriating text, and materialising association, error, and distraction to visualise how sense might be sought, rejected, and re-fused. As part of her Ph.D. research, she developed a method which explores the act of reading as writing as making — read(writ)ing — the term underpins her practice which cuts together-apart processes related to these actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has exhibited widely in the UK, recently having her work, Catching sight of the Salt cellar, included in the group show: The Salon for a Speculative Future at Chisenhale Studios, London and the resulting compendium of work, published by MA Bibliotheque. She took part in the first Interrupteur Artist residency in the faculty of Humanities at the University of Sheffield in 2018. This two-month residency involved working with Artists and forging dialogue with Academics from the Humanities dept. to explore and create collaborations between practice and research ideas. Her latest book read(writ)ing words: a meandering material dialogue is available from Penteract Press, and she has been interviewed for the Penteract Poetry Podcast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debbie Kent works with sound, cities and walking. I’m currently making a set of audio walks tracking transformations in the urban soundscape for a practise-based PhD in the Visual Cultures department. I work with the spontaneous and transient; with disassembling language and retrieving detritus from the cracks in the everyday. In the past I’ve exchanged words from Bruce Springsteen lyrics with members of the public, reassembled news stories using only the conjunctions and articles, and read from the writings of George Perec after putting the pages through a shredder. Recently I have been working in collaboration with Russian artist Alisa Oleva as the Demolition Project, making work that explores ways of reimagining the city and our relationship with it, in London, Berlin, Belgrade, Vilnius, Ekaterinburg and Moscow. – dejakay.co.uk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helen Frosi is an interdisciplinary artist, curator and producer whose practice pivots around ecological thought, poetics, aspects of gifting and alternative forms of economy, with a focus on the creative, social, and political dimension of sound and listening. Her practice manifests as process, and necessitates collaborative, cross-disciplinary work, communal projects and collective activities. Helen is Co-Curator of Longplayer Day, a festival focusing on time, duration and long-term and ecological thinking, and her latest project, EnCOUnTErs, sits at the nexus between art and ecology, with a focus on the sonic imagination. Helen is Director of SoundFjord a nomadic curatorial platform focussed on sound-related research and practice, Founder of Visible Near Midnight Recordings for works that fall between the genre gaps, and a honorary research fellow at Goldsmiths, University of London.

&lt;p&gt;Katarina Rankovic is a text-based artist exploring the extent to which personhood is encoded in character, and whether fictional characters can be reverse-engineered into something approximating persons; into literary prototypes of general artificial intelligence. Recent projects involve Anomaline, a novel about a lethargic antiperson; as using personality tests on her performed fictional characters, in a bid to problematise the distinction between ‘genuine’ being and ‘disingenuous’ performing. As a Serb-born-in-Yorkshire-raised-in-Norway, both the theory and practice of Katarina’s work originates from the daily necessity of inhabiting and switching between many selves. – katarinarankovic.art&lt;/p&gt;
