<p><strong>Debbie Kent</strong>: I work with sound, cities and walking. I’m currently making a set of audio walks tracking transformations in the urban soundscape for a practise-based PhD in the Visual Cultures department. I work with the spontaneous and transient; with disassembling language and retrieving detritus from the cracks in the everyday. In the past I’ve exchanged words from Bruce Springsteen lyrics with members of the public, reassembled news stories using only the conjunctions and articles, and read from the writings of George Perec after putting the pages through a shredder. Recently I have been working in collaboration with Russian artist Alisa Oleva as the Demolition Project, making work that explores ways of reimagining the city and our relationship with it, in London, Berlin, Belgrade, Vilnius, Ekaterinburg and Moscow. – <a href="http://www.dejakay.co.uk">dejakay.co.uk</a></p>

<p><strong>Peter Ainsworth</strong> is a Senior Lecturer in Photography at LCC, UAL and undertaking a PhD in the department of Visual Culture at Goldsmiths. His work as an artist and researcher engages with new forms of the photographic - and particularly with ideas of where and how the image may be expanding through new technological processes. – <a href="http://www.peterainsworth.net">peterainsworth.net</a></p>
