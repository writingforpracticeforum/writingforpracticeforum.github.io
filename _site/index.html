     <p>Dani Smith will present excerpts from a collection of d​iary entries detailing her time returning home to Los Banos, a small farming town in central California, for Christmas 2020.

     <p>Artist and PhD researcher Debbie Kent (Goldsmiths) will present some text that wrestles with the difficulty of describing and communicating the experience of soundscapes. Interdisciplinary artist, curator and producer Helen Frosi joins us as respondent.</p>

<p><strong>Debbie Kent</strong>: I work with sound, cities and walking. I’m currently making a set of audio walks tracking transformations in the urban soundscape for a practise-based PhD in the Visual Cultures department. I work with the spontaneous and transient; with disassembling language and retrieving detritus from the cracks in the everyday. In the past I’ve exchanged words from Bruce Springsteen lyrics with members of the public, reassembled news stories using only the conjunctions and articles, and read from the writings of George Perec after putting the pages through a shredder. Recently I have been working in collaboration with Russian artist Alisa Oleva as the Demolition Project, making work that explores ways of reimagining the city and our relationship with it, in London, Berlin, Belgrade, Vilnius, Ekaterinburg and Moscow. – <a href="http://www.dejakay.co.uk">dejakay.co.uk</a></p>

     <p>This forum will be held on Zoom due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Whilst this is not our usual format for a conversation, which is usually informed by a certain kind of co-presence in a room, as Elly’s work explores the digital body we are hoping that this will add a further experiential dimension as we find ourselves transformed into data through zoom. We hope the potential trickiness of communicating in this way will inform the discussion. Artist and PhD researcher Elly Clarke (Goldsmiths) will present new writing. Poet, fiction writer and educator Keith Jarrett (University of London) joins as respondent.</p>
