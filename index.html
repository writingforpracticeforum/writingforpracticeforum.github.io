	<h1>Writing For Practice Forum</h1>
	<p>The Writing for Practice Forum is a peer-led training opportunity offered in collaboration between artists and researchers at Goldsmiths College and Sheffield Hallam University. It was initiated by Kate Pickering and Rowena Harris in 2018 and is now organised by Katarina RankoviÄ‡ (GC) and Julia Calver (SHU). The forum is a discursive space in which to gain valuable feedback on imaginative or experimental approaches with text-based material. It is open to all researchers within Goldsmiths and SHU, other CHASE institutions and beyond as either presenting writers or discussion participants and requires no prior knowledge or preparation, other than an interest in developing a deeper understanding of writing as part of practice-based research.</p>

	<p>Prior to each forum, the presenting writer chooses an excerpt of their own writing, alongside another short text by a related author as a frame of reference for the discussion. The researcher has the opportunity to invite a guest respondent to participate in the forum. Texts are available online beforehand, but pre-reading is not mandatory; we read the texts aloud at the beginning of the discussion. Researchers can attend as many or as few of the forums as their commitments allow, but are required to sign up for the session in advance.</p>
